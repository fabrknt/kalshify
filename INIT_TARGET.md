**early-stage startups and emerging protocols**
(Series A or earlier, or launched within the last 12–18 months).

## 1. Ethereum (ETH)

### **DeFi Protocols (Early/Niche)**

1. **Fluid (by Instadapp):** A new modular DeFi protocol that combines lending, vaults, and smart accounts into one hyper-efficient layer.
2. **Juice Finance:** An innovative yield-farming enhancer that allows users to access high-leverage points-farming and yield on top of other protocols.
3. **Napier Finance:** A liquidity hub for yield trading that introduces a new primitive for "yield curves" on Ethereum.
4. **Term Finance:** A protocol bringing fixed-rate lending to Ethereum through periodic auctions, targeting institutional-style predictability.
5. **Peapods Finance:** An emerging "Volatility-as-a-Service" protocol that enables decentralized index funds with a focus on yield generation.

### **Infrastructure (The New "Pipes")**

1. **Adamik:** A universal API startup that allows developers to connect to 40+ blockchains via a single, standardized interface.
2. **Voltius:** A young US-based startup using AI/ML to automate smart contract audits and threat detection.
3. **Lobby:** A developer-focused tool building "social infrastructure" for DAOs and on-chain organizations.
4. **Lagrange:** A ZK-infrastructure project enabling cross-chain state proofs, allowing dApps to "prove" data from one chain to another securely.
5. **Spire:** A "Rollup-as-a-service" focused on **app-specific L3s** that settle directly to Ethereum or its major L2s.

## 2. Base (Coinbase L2)

### **DeFi Protocols (Emerging)**

1. **Avantis:** A young, high-leverage synthetic perpetuals protocol built natively for the Base ecosystem.
2. **Aerodrome's "Slipstream" LPs:** While Aerodrome is large, the independent teams building **automated liquidity managers** on top of it (like **Concentric**) are still small.
3. **Infinex:** A "user-layer" DeFi project (by Synthetix founders) designed to make Base feel like a centralized exchange for retail users.
4. **Morpho Blue (Base Deployments):** Specifically the teams building "Vaults" on Morpho Base, such as **Steakhouse Financial's** managed lending pools.
5. **Swaap:** A market-making protocol that protects liquidity providers from "toxic flow" (arbitrageurs).

### **Infrastructure (Young & Base-Native)**

1. **Goldsky:** A real-time data indexing company that has become the "subgraph" alternative of choice for the Base community.
2. **Pimlico:** The current leader in **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)** infrastructure, making "gasless" apps possible on Base.
3. **Openfort:** A "Wallet-as-a-Service" provider that helps game developers on Base hide the blockchain from their users.
4. **Daimo:** A young startup building a P2P payment app (Venmo-style) using stablecoins natively on the Base network.
5. **Blockscout (Base Instance):** The open-source explorer team, which remains a small, mission-driven alternative to Etherscan.

## 3. Arbitrum (ARB)

### **DeFi Protocols (Arbitrum Orbit & L3s)**

1. **Hyperliquid:** A fast-growing, high-performance perpetual DEX that operates on its own dedicated L1/L3 stack.
2. **Dolomite:** A next-generation money market and DEX that allows for "yield-bearing collateral"—a step beyond traditional lending.
3. **Contango:** A unique protocol that builds "perpetuals" out of spot lending markets (like Aave) to offer lower rates.
4. **Ramses Exchange:** A "ve(3,3)" DEX (similar to Aerodrome) but focused on the Arbitrum ecosystem and its unique L3 chains.
5. **Winr Protocol:** A decentralized "gaming-liquidity" engine that powers on-chain betting and casino-style dApps on Arbitrum.

### **Infrastructure (Stylus & Orbit Focused)**

1. **Zeeve:** A specialized "Rollup-as-a-Service" that helps small teams launch their own **Arbitrum Orbit** chains in minutes.
2. **Espresso Systems:** Developing a "Shared Sequencer" to help all the new Arbitrum Orbit chains talk to each other without delays.
3. **AltLayer:** A "Restaked Rollup" provider that adds a layer of security to small Arbitrum-based chains.
4. **Gelato (Arbitrum Focus):** While older, their new **Relay and Functions** tools are specifically being used by young Arbitrum projects to automate complex tasks.
5. **Caldera:** One of the main providers for Arbitrum Orbit infrastructure, helping small projects manage their own dedicated blockspace.

## 4. Solana (SOL)

### **DeFi Protocols (The "New Guard")**

1. **Sanctum:** A protocol building the "Liquid Staking Infinity" layer, allowing anyone to create their own liquid staking token (LST).
2. **Parcl:** A real-estate focused DeFi platform that lets users trade "square footage" prices of global cities.
3. **Flash Trade:** A younger, asset-backed perpetual exchange that uses a "pool" model for high-efficiency trading.
4. **Phoenix (by Ellipsis Labs):** A fully on-chain, limit order book DEX that is significantly faster and more "lean" than previous iterations.
5. **Meteora:** A dynamic liquidity provider protocol focused on maximizing yield for LPs through "DLMM" (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) technology.

### **Infrastructure (Developer Tools)**

1. **Helius:** A small but dominant team providing the "developer platform" for Solana (RPCs, Webhooks, and data APIs).
2. **Ironforge:** A cloud-based developer platform that simplifies the deployment and monitoring of Solana programs.
3. **Armani Ferrante’s "Anza":** A new, small development entity focused solely on the core optimization of the Solana validator client.
4. **Clockwork:** A "smart contract automation" engine for Solana, allowing for scheduled tasks and event-driven triggers.
5. **Squads:** The infrastructure behind most Solana treasuries; a multi-sig and "smart account" platform for teams.
