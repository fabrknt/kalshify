# FABRKNT

**DeFi insights, not just data.**

---

We build insight-driven tools for the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Our mission is to make DeFi accessible by surfacing the insights that matter—without overwhelming users with raw data.

## What We're Building

**[fabrknt.com](https://www.fabrknt.com)** — A yield intelligence platform that helps you find sustainable DeFi opportunities through:

- **AI-Powered Recommendations** — Risk-adjusted pool picks, not just highest APY
- **Curator Strategies** — Learn from how pros like Gauntlet allocate capital
- **Yield Opportunities** — Cross-protocol spread detection with net-of-cost analysis
- **Educational Tools** — Protocol comparisons, LST analysis, IL calculators
