# FABRKNT: Web3 Index, Curate & Synergy Platform

**Verify Web3. Curate Dependencies. Discover Synergy.**

**Pitch decks lie. On-chain data doesn't.**

**Domain:** `www.fabrknt.com`

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** FABRKNT

**Concept:** A Web3 Index & Synergy platform built for **early verification**. We help **Web3 Corp Dev teams, investors, and founders** verify companies using real on-chain activity, GitHub signals, and social data — fully automated, no self-reporting.

**Products:** Three integrated products: **INDEX** (Web3 Company Verification), **CURATE** (Dependency Graph & Tech Stack Analysis), and **SYNERGY** (Professional Partnership Discovery). INDEX provides automated verification that shows what Web3 companies actually do — not what they say. CURATE maps how projects are interconnected through dependencies, SDK usage, and shared technology stacks. SYNERGY leverages INDEX and CURATE data to discover synergy opportunities with verified companies — enabling strategic connections through AI-powered compatibility analysis.

**Architecture:** **Index → Curate → Synergy** - INDEX serves as the data foundation, CURATE adds technical relationship mapping, and SYNERGY powers compatibility analysis and recommendations. Every synergy opportunity is backed by verified INDEX data and technical relationship insights from CURATE, ensuring transparency and trust.

**Positioning:** **AI × Verified Data × Professional Discovery** - Maximizing automation through AI to enable intelligent partnership discovery and strategic connections in the Web3 market, where information asymmetry is high.

## 2. Market Opportunity

### Web3 Market Growth

The Web3 market is estimated to be between **$3.47 billion and $7.23 billion** as of 2025, with projections to expand to **$41.4 billion – $42.3 billion by 2030** (CAGR of approximately 42%–45%).

### SME Segment Opportunity

The growth rate of SMEs within the Web3 market is particularly noteworthy. While large enterprises currently lead with a 60.9% market share, the **SME segment is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 54.6% through 2030**, outstripping the pace of large corporations.

-   **Active Seed and Small-Scale Deals:** Approximately 36.4% of funding rounds are concentrated in the $1M to $5M range, making the seed round the most active phase.
-   **The Necessity of Consolidation:** Many small projects face resource shortages and intensifying competition. We have entered a "Consolidation Phase" where SMEs with high technical capabilities are being absorbed into larger ecosystems.

### Global Market Positioning

The platform serves the global Web3 ecosystem, focusing on SMEs that require efficient, data-driven partnership discovery and strategic connections. As the market moves from "speculation to utility" and "isolation to integration," an infrastructure where AI bridges the gap between technology and business based on verified data is indispensable for the development of the global Web3 ecosystem.

## 3. AI Automation & Efficiency

The vision of "maximizing automation through AI" drastically improves the cost and time efficiency of partnership discovery and due diligence processes in the Web3 market.

### Quantitative Evaluation of AI-Driven Efficiency

-   **Accelerated Sourcing and Evaluation:** By using AI algorithms to identify targets, the time required to locate and evaluate companies can be reduced by **over 50%**.
-   **High-Speed Document Processing:** AI agents utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) can process thousands of financial and legal documents in minutes to extract inconsistencies or legal risks. This shortens the review period for mid-market deals from weeks to days.
-   **Democratization of Technical Evaluation:** AI auditing tools detect smart contract vulnerabilities and assign security scores (0–100%). Furthermore, they translate complex code into language understandable by non-technical investors and executives.

### Three-Tier Data Integration

AI seamlessly combines three layers of data to provide a holistic view:

1. **On-chain:** Real-time monitoring of "Smart Money" movements and TVL trends via APIs (e.g., Nansen, Dune). Verified on-chain protocol fees, transaction volumes, and wallet quality metrics.
2. **Off-chain:** Traditional financial and legal information, GitHub activity, team contribution data, and service activity metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU).
3. **Online:** Sentiment analysis to distinguish between bot activity (airdrop farming) and genuine community growth. Social media metrics and community engagement data.

## 4. Platform Architecture: Index → Curate → Synergy

The platform operates on a three-tier architecture where **Index** serves as the data foundation, **Curate** maps technical relationships, and **Synergy** enables partnership discovery.

### 4.1. INDEX: Web3 Company Verification

**INDEX** is an automated index that shows what Web3 companies actually do — not what they say.
